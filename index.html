        <p>November 21, 2021</p>
        <p>NEW YORK—This spring, a 15-year-old Afghan boy named Mohammed found himself wandering in the forests of eastern Croatia alone. He and his relatives, who numbered about ten, including small babies and older adults, had that day crossed over the border from Bosnia into EU-member state Croatia, where they hoped to rest in a refugee camp until traveling on to Western Europe to seek asylum.</p>
        <p>But the family was caught by Croatian police officers, and in the confusion, Mohammed got lost from his relatives, who were illegally deported back to Bosnia without being allowed to apply for asylum, what is known as a “pushback.”</p>
        <p>The teenager, however, managed to press on, and made it to Austria. Once there, he lodged an asylum claim and waited for his family to join him, according to his relatives. (Mohammed’s last name is being withheld because he is a minor.)</p>
        <p>Mohammed is just one of thousands of unaccompanied minors who have sought asylum in Austria this year. Unaccompanied minors (UAMs), which accounted for <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20210423-1">10% of all asylum applications</a> in the EU last year, are defined as children under 18 traveling without a parent or legal guardian; a child traveling with an uncle is therefore still considered a UAM.</p>
        <p>While recent data shows that UAM arrivals are increasing in many European countries, including Bulgaria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, in Austria the numbers are shooting up. In January, 155 children applied for asylum in Austria, while in August, the last month for which complete data is available, 795 children did, a roughly 400% increase. All asylum applications in the EU increased by 12% in the first half of 2021 from the same period the previous year, according to statistics from the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/promoting-our-european-way-life/statistics-migration-europe_en#developmentsin20192018">European Commission</a>.</p>

      <div class="story">
        <p>The numbers are stark, but Austria asylum experts don’t have a clear understanding of why the figures for unaccompanied minors specifically are increasing so exponentially this year.</p>
        <p>Looking at the numbers of children arriving this year reminds Katharina Glawischnig of 2014. She works for Asylkoordination Österreich, an umbrella advocacy group of asylum lawyers and experts, and saw firsthand the effects of the ‘European refugee crisis’ of 2015, when hundreds of thousands of refugees headed for Europe’s shores, mostly fleeing the war in Syria. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps00191/default/table?lang=en">Some 88,000 people</a> applied for asylum in Austria in 2015.</p>
        <p>Now, Glawischnig has premonitions similar to the ones she had just before thousands came to Austria’s door. Austria is at “the beginning of a crisis,” she says. “We had Syria, and now we have Afghanistan.”</p>
        <p>Theresa Lahr, an asylum lawyer representing UAMs for the city of Vienna’s Child and Youth Welfare Service, attributes the rise to multiple factors, including the long-term instability in Afghanistan, which caused hundreds of thousands to flee even before the U.S. withdrawal, as well as a worsening situation in Syria.</p>
        <p>Lahr notes that many of the children who arrived in Austria this year—“like 99%”—are very young Syrian children who came to Austria via Albania with the aid of smugglers. Some, Lahr says, are only eight or nine years old, and their parents paid high fees to smuggle their children in just a few days from Syria or Turkey to Austria, a journey that takes many other asylum-seekers years.</p>
        <p>“My personal guess is that the Albanian mafia got into smuggling a little bit,” Lahr says, noting, however, that this is “really just speculation,” as there is no way to empirically prove why so many children are coming.</p>
        <p>Glawischnig of Asylkoordination says many of the recently-arrived children are also coming via Bulgaria, which also saw a noticeable increase in asylum applications this year, and through western Balkan countries like Bosnia, as did Mohammed, the 15-year-old Afghan boy separated earlier this year from his family.</p>
        <p>The routes through Europe are dangerous for anyone, but more so for children traveling without their parents. At least 18,000 unaccompanied minors <a href"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/21/nearly-17-child-migrants-a-day-vanished-in-europe-since-2018">disappeared in Europe</a> in 2018.</p>
        <p>But Glawischnig is quick to point out that the number of arriving children does not constitute “a real crisis.” Rather, she says, it is a crisis of management.</p>
        <p>“We had more asylum seekers before and were able to manage them. And now, they [the Austrian government] are just not able to organize themselves,” Glawischnig says. “They said everything would be great and perfect. And now we see they are not organized and not able to handle this.”</p>
        <p>Glawischnig believes the problem lies in the way Austria’s federal system handles unaccompanied minors.</p>
        <p>Austria is divided into nine federal states, known as <i>länder</i>. In seven of the <i>länder</i>, children are immediately brought to residential-style facilities while their asylum claims are reviewed.</p>
        <p>But if children happen to arrive to the other two <i>länder</i> (one of which is the city of Vienna), they are sent to Traiskirchen, a large camp just south of Vienna which was notorious in 2015 for its <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/10/12/austria-migrants-global-post/73806236/">squalid, overcrowded conditions</a> that saw families sleeping outside in tents in one of the richest countries in Europe.</p>
        <p>“We had 900 children sleeping on the floor or in tents,” Glawischnig recalls of the camp in 2015. “If it was raining, families took some blankets to put over the children so that they would not get wet while they were sleeping.”</p>
        <p>While conditions at Traiskirchen have vastly improved, experts agree it is no place to hold a child for long.</p>
        <p>But Glawischnig says there are currently some 800 unaccompanied minors who have been waiting for six to nine months in Traiskirchen for their documents to be reviewed before being transferred to a residential facility in one of the <i>länder</i>. A usual wait time at Traiskirchen might be two or four months. While they are staying in the large camp, children are not able to attend Austrian school.</p>
        <p>Such a rapid increase in the amount of children entering Austria this year created a backlog in the asylum system. But it was a backlog that was entirely avoidable, experts concur.</p>
        <p>Austria’s asylum process is lengthy, and children often stay for years in the family-style residential facilities, foster care, or group homes across Austria’s nine <i>länders</i>.</p>
        <p>But after 2015, the number of refugees arriving to the country dropped dramatically, according to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tps00191/default/table?lang=en">official figures</a>. The residential facilities are paid a flat daily rate per child they house, so when fewer children arrived, many of the facilities were forced to shut their doors.</p>
        <p>Glawischnig says there used to be about 2,000 to 2,500 places for unaccompanied children. Now, there are only around 600 places in these group homes.</p>
        <p>“Now we are missing these facilities. It’s a stupid system, actually,” says Glawischnig. “You would need these facilities to be paid all the time.”</p>
        <p>Dieter Schrattenholzer is the director of SOS-Kinderdorf Vienna, one of these residential facilities, which supported 77 minors last year, housing some of them in group homes and others in foster care with Austrian families. The organization hires staff to care for the children, acting as surrogate parents.</p>
        <p>But the daily rate organizations like SOS-Kinderdorf Vienna are allocated per child hasn’t increased in years, says Schrattenholzer, making it difficult for him to pay his workers a fair wage and keep up with rising taxes.</p>
        <p>“We say all the time, please give us a higher daily rate because it is much more expensive than it was five years ago,” Schrattenholzer explains. “We want to help. But it costs.”</p>
        <p>The daily allowance for an unaccompanied minor is 95 euros, Glawischnig says. But facilities hosting Austrian-born children in similar group homes receive “at least 120 euros.”</p>
        <p>“For unaccompanied minors, we have less money to take care of them. But they are also children,” Glawischnig says. “They need care. They don’t know the language. Some even don't know how to read and write. They are traumatized.”</p>
        <p>In Austria, Glawischnig says unaccompanied minors are treated as <i>halbe Kinder</i>, or half-children. Treating them this way certainly does the children a disservice, but also hurts Austrian society in the long run, she believes.</p>
        <p>“If we are taking good care of the children while they are minors, they will work afterwards and they will give back through working,” Glawischnig says. “We are one of the richest countries in the world...It’s just the problem where you have your priorities.”</p>
        <p>For children arriving to Austria, getting into a group home is just the beginning of a long road of challenges. It’s easy for kids to slip through the cracks.</p>
        <p>Many UAMs arriving now have family members living in Europe and want to reunite with them. If the relative lives in Germany or Sweden, for example, the child will travel on from Austria to those countries, and the asylum system loses track of their case.</p>
        <p>“We don’t know what happens to these children, if they are arriving to their family members or if they are trafficked,” Glawischnig says. Around half of the UAMs in Austria effectively “disappear,” she estimates.</p>
        <p>Some children are eager to bring their families to Austria once they have received a positive asylum decision. But Austria grants two different kinds of asylum, full asylum and subsidiary protection. In 2016, Austria <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXV/I/I_00996/fname_498905.pdf">amended</a> its asylum law, raising the standards for a successful family reunification case. Those granted only subsidiary protection, for example, now have to wait three years before they can even apply to bring relatives to Austria.</p>
        <p>In 2014-5, Glawischnig says, about ten percent of UAMs were able to bring their families to Austria. Now, she says that number is only about two percent.</p>
        <p>Lahr, the asylum lawyer for the city of Vienna, says the shift in policy has had disastrous effects on the lives of unaccompanied minors who want nothing more than to see their parents.</p>
        <p>“We have a lot of very, very desperate children separated from their parents,” Lahr says. “They have a lot of pressure from their parents. They have the feeling of having totally failed. This is like a catastrophe in the making with them.”</p>
        <p>This June, this reporter met with the family of Mohammed, the Afghan boy who traveled alone to Austria, in an abandoned house in Šturlić, a town in northwest Bosnia just a stone’s throw from the Croatian border.</p>
        <p>Every day, Mohammed’s family would shoulder their backpacks, gather their children, and hike through the forest into Croatia, trying to reach a refugee camp for families in Zagreb. They were pushed back dozens of times by Croatian border forces, an <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2021/5/25/the-afghan-fathers-risking-beatings-to-reach-family-in-croatia">increasingly common practice</a> that seeks to shut refugees out of the European Union.</p>
        <p>In the abandoned house, Mohammed’s cousins sat on an old carpet surrounded by their belongings and video called Mohammed, who was reclining on his new bed in the home of his Austrian foster family. Mohammed seemed in good spirits, and said he was quickly learning German in school.</p>
        <p>In the end, the family didn’t need to wait years for the slow wheels of Austria’s family reunification process to turn. Mohammed’s relatives managed to reach Croatia one day this summer, and traveled on to Berlin. Eager to see his family after months of separation, Mohammed left Austria and joined them in the German capital, becoming one of Austria’s “disappeared” children.</p>

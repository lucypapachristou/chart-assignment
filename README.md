# chart-assignment

Hi Nikhil! I already discussed my project with you last week, but to restate: I'm interested in exploring the story behind this data I found on EuroStat, the statistical office of the European Union (so as official and legit as you can get) about asylum applications for unaccompanied minors in Europe. At [this link](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/migration-asylum/asylum/database) you can find a bunch of data that the EU keeps on asylum, from asylum applications to asylum decisions--first and second decisions--to 'Dublin' statistics, Dublin meaning the Dublin Regulation. The EU also keeps separate data on unaccompanied minors, and this is what I want to focus on. But I will compare the unaccompanied minor stats to the changes in asylum applications in general.

I'm attaching the .xlsx file of the dataset I'm interested in, Unaccompanied minor asylum applicants by type of applicant, citizenship, age and sex - monthly data (rounded). Here it is: [MIGR_ASYUMACTM$DEFAULTVIEW1636322181160.xlsx](https://github.com/lucypapachristou/chart-assignment/files/7493186/MIGR_ASYUMACTM.DEFAULTVIEW1636322181160.xlsx)

(For the chart I'm going to make, I'll cut out some of these countries that aren't as relevant, or that have zero applications, because there are way too many data points and the chart will look super messy. The most relevant countries are the non-Scandanavian EU countries: Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Switzerland--not in EU. For some reason I can't figure out France isn't in this EuroStat data set, but I'll find France's data elsewhere. These are the top countries for asylum-seekers, so I think it makes the most sense to focus on these.)

But there is also this other dataset, Asylum applicants considered to be unaccompanied minors by citizenship, age and sex - annual data (rounded), which shows how many unaccompanied minor asylum seekers there are in each European country since 2011. (In this dataset, you can see the numbers shoot up in 2015, the peak of European 'migration crisis', and decrease in 2020, due to Covid and harsher border policies that keep people out. This second dataset, while not my primary focus, will be useful to give my reader a general sense of the asylum trends. I am thinking of including a chart of that data in my story as well, but not dive into it, let's say. Here's the link to it: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/migr_asyunaa/default/table?lang=en.

So, back to the dataset I'm focusing on: it's pretty simple data, and it's clear to the naked eye that there are some noteworthy trends, namely, that asylum applications for unaccompanied minors (UAMs), really have been shooting up in Austria and Bulgaria in particular. I want to explore why this is. 

Is it seasonal? Again, I doubt it is, as migration is actually not really seasonal in Europe, and plenty of people cross borders in the winter--I have the data to back up that claim if you're interested.

Is it just random, and can't be explained? Well, I sure hope not! Because then it's not really a story...

Does it have something to do with shifting trends at the borders, like, for example, the Turkey-Greece border is becoming more militarized each more (a massive border wall going up). Could this be leading more people to head to Bulgaria from Turkey? 

And with Austria, I know that they have a very 'generous', let's say, program for UAMs. They place the kids with Austrian families, enroll them in school, etc. It is much better, one could argue, than living in a refugee camp in France, or even in Germany, which is usually considered the best country for asylum-seekers.

I'm going to zero in on Austria specifically, though, as I think researching Bulgaria as well will be difficult. For one, there are way fewer support structures in Bulgaria--fewer migration organizations, fewer asylum lawyers/refugee resettlement folks--and it will be harder to find accurate information. In Austria I also have more contacts as a journalist.

I've already found several organizations in Austria I want to approach to learn more about these trends. One is Caritas, the largest refugee aid organization in Austria--they are international, actually. Then there are some smaller asylum offices I will contact. I also know one or two Austrian asylum lawyers personally. I'm really hoping these folks can help me understand why these numbers are going up.

As I also mentioned to you, Nikhil, I have a suspicion that some families are deliberately separating along the route to Europe and sending their children ahead to countries like Austria, where they will have more opportunities, rather than traveling together as a family and living together in a squalid camp. This would be REALLY interesting to explore, as there is much less knowledge about deliberate family separation in Europe than there is in the US, for example, where we all know that refugees/migrants from Central America send their children alone to cross the US border. I know two families personally whose stories relate to this. One is an Afghan family whose son ended up alone in Austria this summer, so I'll reach out to them. Another is a family from Bangldesh I met in a Croatian refugee camp who told me they wanted to send their son ahead alone, while the parents and the baby sister went to France to seek asylum. Again, I'm contacting that guy straight away.

OK, to answer directly your pitch questions:

1) Proposed headline: "Uptick in asylum applications of children in Austria due to X, Y reasons, asylum lawyers say" - again, I don't know those reasons yet, but they will go in the headline!

2) As stated above, I want to answer why these numbers are going up.

3) As I'm still waiting to hear back from these lawyers, I haven't found answers yet. I've poked around in the news, too, but it's hard because obviously the most relevant news will be in German. I have some German and Austrian friends who I've asked to help me sift through the news and give me a better sense of the asylum laws in Austria.
